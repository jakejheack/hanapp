# Type Casting Fix Test Guide

## Issue Description
The error "type 'int' is not a subtype of type 'String?' in type cast" was occurring when users opened the verification page using Google and Facebook accounts, while email/password accounts worked properly.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by:
1. **Database inconsistency**: Some string fields (like `verification_status`, `badge_status`) were being returned as integers from the database for social login users
2. **Backend API responses**: PHP backend was not explicitly casting these values to strings
3. **Flutter model parsing**: The User model's `safeString` and `safeNullableString` methods needed better handling of integer values

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced User Model Type Safety (`lib/models/user.dart`)
- Improved `safeString()` method to handle int, double, and bool values
- Enhanced `safeNullableString()` method with explicit type checking
- Added better error handling for type conversion

### 2. Verification Screen Error Handling (`lib/screens/verification_screen.dart`)
- Added `_safeStringValue()` helper method for safe type conversion
- Enhanced error logging with stack traces
- Added debugging information to track data types

### 3. Backend API Type Consistency
- **Google Auth API** (`hanapp_backend/api/auth/google_auth.php`): Added explicit string casting for `verification_status` and `badge_status`
- **Facebook Auth API** (`hanapp_backend/api/auth/facebook_auth.php`): Added explicit string casting for status fields
- **Verification Status API** (`hanapp_backend/api/verification/get_verification_status.php`): Added string casting for all URL fields

### 4. AuthService Error Handling (`lib/utils/auth_service.dart`)
- Added try-catch blocks around User.fromJson() calls
- Enhanced logging to show raw data causing parsing errors
- Added stack trace logging for better debugging

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Google Sign-In
1. Open the app
2. Sign in using Google account
3. Navigate to verification screen
4. Verify no type casting errors occur
5. Check console logs for proper data types

### 2. Test Facebook Sign-In
1. Open the app
2. Sign in using Facebook account
3. Navigate to verification screen
4. Verify no type casting errors occur
5. Check console logs for proper data types

### 3. Test Email/Password (Regression Test)
1. Open the app
2. Sign in using email/password
3. Navigate to verification screen
4. Verify functionality still works as expected

## Expected Results
- No more "type 'int' is not a subtype of type 'String?'" errors
- Verification screen loads successfully for all authentication methods
- Console logs show proper data type handling
- All string fields are properly converted from any input type

## Debug Information
If issues persist, check the console logs for:
- `VerificationScreen: Status data received:` - Shows raw API response
- `VerificationScreen: verification_status type:` - Shows data type
- `AuthService: Creating User from backend response:` - Shows user data structure
- `AuthService: Error creating User from JSON:` - Shows parsing errors

## Additional Notes
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- All type conversions are safe and handle null values
- The solution works for both new and existing users
- No database schema changes were required
