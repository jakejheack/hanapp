# ASAP Listing Form Fee Labels Update

## Overview
Updated the ASAP listing form to use consistent fee terminology that matches the public listing form.

## Changes Made

### 1. Input Field Label
- **Before**: "Price *"
- **After**: "Doer Fee *"
- **Location**: `lib/screens/lister/asap_listing_form_screen.dart` line 762

### 2. Validation Messages
Updated all validation error messages to reference "doer fee" instead of "price":
- "Please enter a price" → "Please enter a doer fee"
- "Price must be greater than zero" → "Doer fee must be greater than zero"
- "Minimum price is Php 500.00" → "Minimum doer fee is Php 500.00"
- "Maximum price is Php 999,999.99" → "Maximum doer fee is Php 999,999.99"

### 3. Error Messages
Updated error messages in the form submission logic:
- "Price must be at least Php 500. Please check the Price field." → "Doer Fee must be at least Php 500. Please check the Doer Fee field."

## Fee Structure
The ASAP listing form maintains the same fee structure:
- **Doer Fee**: The amount entered by the user (minimum Php 500)
- **Transaction Fee**: Fixed at Php 25.00
- **Total Amount**: Doer Fee + Transaction Fee

## Testing
Created test file `test_asap_listing_fee_labels.dart` to verify:
- Input field displays "Doer Fee *" label
- Fee display section shows correct labels
- Validation messages use "doer fee" terminology

## Consistency
This change ensures consistency between:
- Public listing form (already uses "Doer Fee")
- ASAP listing form (now uses "Doer Fee")
- Both forms show the same fee structure and terminology

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/lister/asap_listing_form_screen.dart`
- `test_asap_listing_fee_labels.dart` (new test file)
- `ASAP_LISTING_FEE_LABELS_UPDATE.md` (this documentation)
